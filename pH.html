        <h3><center><b>pH</b></center></h3>

        <h4>Definition</h4>
        <p>The pH of a substance is a measure of how acidic or basic the substance is. 
            Measured on a scale from 0 to 14, pH is based on the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution. In pure 
            water, which is neutral (neither acidic nor basic), the concentration of hydrogen ions corresponds to a pH 
            of 7.0. If a substance has a lot of hydrogen ions, then it is an acid. If a substance has a lot of hydroxide 
            ions, it is a base. Below is a graphic demonstrating a different substance at each point on the pH scale. </p>

        <h4>Importance to Water Quality</h4> 
        <p> The pH of water is a very important measurement concerning water quality. This is because it determines 2 things
            for <b>nutrients</b> (phosphorus, nitrogen, and carbon) and <b>heavy metals</b> (lead, copper, cadmium, etc.)! 
            <ul>
                <li>Solubility (a.k.a. amount that can be dissolved in water)</li>
                <li>Biological Availability (a.k.a. amount that can utilized by aquatic life)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>   

        <p> Therefore, if we use nitrogen as an example, not only does pH affect how much and what form it is most abundant in
            the water, it ALSO determines whether aquatic life can use it. In the case of heavy metals, the degree to which they
            are soluble determines their toxicity. The lower the pH, the more toxic metals are because they are more soluble. </p>

        <p> Excessively high or low pH can be harmful for the use of water and what lives in it. For example, high pH causes water 
            to have a bitter taste, water pipes can become encrusted with deposits, and it makes the disinfection of chlorine less 
            effective. If chlorine is less effective, more chlorine is added, raising the pH of the water. On the other hand, low pH
            will corrode or dissolve metals and other substances.
        </p>    

        <h6>What causes a waterbody to have a low pH?</h6> 
        
        <p> <b>The short answer... <u>pollution!!</u></b></p>

        <p> Below is a list of more specific examples: </p>
        <ul>
            
            <li>Mine waste/historic mine sites</li>

            <li>Coal pile runoff</li>
            <li>Industrial discharge</li>
            <li>Landfills</li>
            <li>Draining of wetlands/floodplains</li>
            <li>Precipitation/acid rain</li>
        </ul>

        <h6>What causes a waterbody to have a high pH?</h6>   
        <ul>
            <li>Industrial discharge</li>
            <li>Alkaline geology and soils</li>
            <li>Asphalt production/disposal</li>
            <li>Agriculture</li>
            <li>Oil and gas brines</li>
            <li>Cement manufacturing</li>
            <li>Soap manufacturing</li>
            <li>Limestone gravel roads</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Why does this matter?</h4> 
    <ul>
    <li>If the pH of water is too high or too low, it can be harmful to plants and animals living in and using that water.</li>
        <dd> - For example, high pH levels damage the gills and skin of aqautic organisms, like fish. If the pH rises about 10, 
            they will eventually die from ammonia poisoning. </dd> 
        <dd> - For example, low pH levels make aquatic organisms more susceptible to fungal infections and disease in general. 
        </dd>  
    
    <li>If the pH of water is too high, it can be harmful to humans. </li>      
        <dd> - For example, high pH levels makes water taste more bitter as well as can cause skin irritation. </dd>
    
    <li>If the pH of water is too high, it can alter water systems. </li>   
        <dd> - For example, as stated, high pH levels lower the effectiveness of chlorine causing the need for additional chlorine
            in water. This addition raises the pH of the water in order to improve the water quality. This can be very costly to
            many industries as well including swimming pool centers, water purification, industrial waster, and sewage systems. 
        </dd>
        <dd> - For example, low pH levels by increasing the solubility of minerals and releasing metals and other chemical
            substances into the water. 
        </dd>

    </ul>

    <h4>According to the U.S EPA, what should the pH of fresh surface water be to be considered good water quality?</h4>
