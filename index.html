            width="320"
            height="280"
            style="float: right;"/>

            <p>What does this mean?</p>

            <p>... well, it means two <b>major</b> things:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>On this dashboard, the condition of the local surface water in Marion County, IN will be analyzed, 
                    explained, and visualized.  </li>
                <li>On this dashboard, the significance of water quality will also be explained (i.e., why do we care?).</li>
            </ol>

            <p>In order to analyze water quality, we need <b>data</b>! From the late 1990s until present, the Marion County Public 
                Health Department (MCPHD) has been sampling various locations. </p>

            <p>The MCPHD is located in Marion County, IN (<a href = "https://marionhealth.org/surface-water-program/">https://marionhealth.org/surface-water-program/</a>). A job that they 
                perform is monitoring the condition of local streams and rivers, such as the White River, Eagle Creek, and Fall 
                Creek. They do this by collecting and testing a variety of bacteria, physical, and chemical parameters. These 
                are called pollutants. The results tell them what warning signs to post. If the results come back good, meaning 
                there are a low number of pollutants in the water, for an area, they will post a green sign that says, “safe”. 
                If the results come back good, meaning there are a low number of pollutants in the water, for an area, they will 
                post a green sign that says, “not safe”. If the water is not safe, people should not swim, play, or drink from 
                that water.  </p>    

            <p>In Marion County, there are 54 sites that they monitor five times per month for the following parameters: </p>

            <p>So... this might be the point where you are beginning to ask the following questions: 
                <b>Who cares? What is the point?</b> Just keep reading!! We are getting there!  </p>

            <p> Just like other counties containing major counties containing major cities, Marion County, IN has 
                experienced a huge acceleration of urbanization over the last few decades. An increase in urbanization 
                usually is associated with an increase in harmful pollutants being discharged into surface water bodies, 
                which directly threatens the ecological environment and human health. Data from health departments, such as 
                the one here in Marion County, are typically uploaded and not analyzed, meaning that they must upload data 
                but unless one has experience with water quality data, one will not know how to interpret it. Therefore, it 
                is important and somewhat urgent to evaluate the comprehensive water quality data given in order to understand 
                and identify the main pollution sources and their ecological and human health impacts. It is also important to 
                “translate” the data and create visualizations that assist people outside of the scientific community with 
                understanding water quality data, especially in their local community. </p>    

            <p> There are a lot of <b>attributes</b>... where do we start?  </p>    

            <p> It is a blessing and a curse that we have so much data and that there is so much being tested!! However, 
                it can make it hard to ultimately determine what is causing water to be not safe for recreation and drinking. 
                The first step that needs to be taken is to reduce the dataset while also keeping most of the information. </p>

            <p> This is where a Principal Component Analysis, also known as a PCA, comes into play. This analysis will reduce 
                the parameters in the dataset to only include the major factors that influence the water quality in the 
                waterways in Marion County, IN.  </p>
