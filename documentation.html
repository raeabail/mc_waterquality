        <h3><center>Key Takeaways of the Water Quality Analysis</center></h3>
        <p>There were overall questions being answered in throughout this interactive webpage. With the questions being posed, 
            visualizations being created, and questions being answered, more in-depth question were produced as a result! </p>

        <p> The following includes the breadth and depth questions as well as a summary of the answers to those questions 
            of the water quality analysis: </p>    

        <ul>
           <h6><li><mark>Question 1: Are there any correlations between the pollutants within the same waterway?</mark></li></h6>
           
           <p>→ The simple answer to this question is yes! This was especially true in the Lower White River where 
            heavy metals were correlated with eachother, E. coli & temperature were correlated with eachother, and the 
        rest of the parameters were correlated with each other. </p>
        <p>→ It was very interesting to see the heavy metals being highly correlated as it led to the following question:
        </p>
        
        <dd><u> Question A: Are there certain areas in Marion County, IN where heavy metals are more likely to contaminate local 
            waterways like the Lower White River than others (i.e. what is the cause of heavy metal contamination)? </u></dd>
       
            <p>→ Heavy metals can contaminate local waterways via household plumbing and service lines, mining operations, 
            petroleum refineries, electronics manufacturers, municipal waste disposal, cement plants, and natural mineral 
            deposits. Therefore, when examining the MCPHD Sampling Locations GEE App, the above industrial facilities 
            can be found in Marion County, but also particularly surrounding the Lower White River compared to Fall Creek 
            and Eagle Creek. </p>    

        <p>Another noticable attribute was E. coli because it was either not correlated with other attributes or very few, 
            which led to the following question: </p>    

        <dd><u> Question B: Are there certain areas in Marion County, IN where E. coli are more likely to contaminate local 
            waterways (i.e. what is the cause of E. coli contamination)? </u></dd>

        <p>→ E. coli contaminates local waterways via combined sewer overflows (CSOs), untreated stormwater, and untreated 
            wasterwater. E. coli is prevalent in each waterway and all small creeks and rivers as well. This makes sense, especially
            when analyzing the spatial maps because one can located all of the CSOs and find areas where untreated stormwater and 
            wastewater would be able to enter the waterways.
        </p>    
            
            <h6><li><mark>Question 2: How do the pollutants change on a spatial scale?</mark></li></h6>

            <p>Based on the PCA results, there were no discrete clusters meaning that the water quality did not differ
                from site to site very much. What does this mean? Without looking at the spatial data, we can assume that pollutants
                travel as a whole. Combining the results of the PCA with the spatial data, we can also confirm this. More details 
                on the results of the terrain analysis are on the spatial data page of this website. However, this leads to two 
                important questions:
            </p>

            <dd><u>Question A: What are the point sources in these waterways and how do they travel?</u></dd>
            <dd><u>Question B: What are the nonpoint sources in these waterways and how do they travel? </u></dd>

            <p>I am going to answer these question together. In order to answer them, we need to differentiate point vs nonpoint
                pollution source. A point source is defined as pollution coming from a single point, such as a factory or sewage 
                treatment plant. A nonpoint source is defined as a source of pollution that issues from widely distributed or 
                pervasive environmental elements. Based on these definitions, it is hard to identify when pollution is coming from 
                a point source in a urban or rural area. An example of a point source is the Deepwater Horizonoil spill in the Gulf of 
                Mexico that released about 134 million gallons of oil in 2010. Runoff from urban and suburban areas is a major origin 
                of non-point source pollution as well as discarded trash.
            </p>

            <p>Therefore, Question A may not be the best question. But, now we know! And they travel typically by accidently and 
                by directly entering a waterway or waterbody. 
            </p>

            <p> On the hand, Question B is a good question because nonpoint sources are going to be the main pollution sources
                in these waterways. They travel based on what the source is and the terrain (see spatial data for terrain results). 
                </p>

                <dd>→ Contaminant: <b>Nitrate/Nitrite/Phosphate</b> = in chemical fertilizers, human sewage, and animal waste and fertilizers. They 
                    can contaminate a private well through groundwater movement and surface water seepage and water run-off</dd>
                <dd>→ Contaminant: <b>Heavy Metals</b> = household plumbing and service lines, mining operations, petroleum refineries, 
                    electronics manufacturers, municipal waste disposal, cement plants, and natural mineral deposits</dd>  
                <dd>→ Contaminant: <b>Sulfate</b> = sewage treatment plants and industrial discharges such as tanneries, pulp mills, and textile mills. 
                    Runoff from fertilized agricultural lands also contributes sulfates to water bodies.</dd>      
                </ul>
    <h6>What I learned!:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>I can connect my knowledge of R, Javascript/GEE, and HTML into one interactive visualization that focuses on 
            not just displaying data visualizations, but also walking the users through them as well as providing analyses. 
        </li>
        <li>The water quality of major waterways in Marion County, IN are more complicated than I initially thought, and I 
            will be redoing some of this later to get more precise data. There are SO many sources of pollution here in Marion County,
            and I want to focus on organizing where those possible sources are and how much they are contributing to the local waterways
            and potentially human health.
        </li>
        <li>The terrain of Marion County, IN is relatively flat; however, surrounding the waterways has inward facing slopes where
            pollution sources can travel via gravity directly into the waterways.
        </li>
    </ul>
        
        <h6>Design Process:</h6>
    <p>I went about designing my visualizations and project as a whole by thinking about it in the context of my research purposes.
        I do a lot of outreach work and science education curriculum; therefore, I wanted this to look like a webpage that was 
        easy to navigate, had multiple pages, had plenty of explanations, videos, apps incorported (GEE), and analysis. To me, 
        science is worthless if you can't explain it and teach it to people outside of the scientific community. 
    </p>

    <p>In terms of my visualizations, for my PCA plots, I chose the colors and shapes I did because I had tons of variables.
        I had so many variables that for the Lower White River Watershed, R didn't have enough shapes for the last 5, and they
        aren't even included in the PCA plot. The colors are kind of random due to the amount of variables. I think when having that
        many, the focus of a particular color palette starts to fade. In terms of my terrain analysis, I have many color palettes that
        are incredibly intentionally. Most of them, such as for elevation, aspect, etc. are all "tradition". What I mean by this is 
        if you look in a GIS paper or application or a DEM image, you will see the exact same or extremely similar color palettes.
        Therefore, I wanted to be consistent with the community instead of having the user trying to figure out a random color palette.
        For example, the DEM layer has a elevation color palette that is widely used. 
    </p>

    <p>I also arranged my charts and visualizations in the way that I did because it seemed the most logical when I was walking 
        through it myself. As I mentioned, this is for educational purposes first, so the first page is all about where the data comes 
        from, what the attributes are, their definitions, their importance to water quality, etc. Then, I have a button at the bottom of the 
        page that directs the user to the next page which is essentially a "How To" of a PCA, etc. 
    </p>
